Background For CarpentryCon@Home 2020, along with Amrita Goswami, I am to prepare and deliver a workshop on &amp;ldquo;Reproducible Environments with the Nix Packaging System&amp;rdquo;. In particular, as a community of practice lesson, the focus is not on packaging (as is typical of most Nix tutorials) nor on the Nix expression language itself, but instead on the use of Nix as a replacement for virtual environments using mkShell.</description></item><item><title>HPC Dotfiles and LMod</title><link>/posts/hpc-dots-lmod/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2020 02:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hpc-dots-lmod/</guid><description>Background My move away from the powerful, but unimaginatively named HPC clusters of IITK 1 brought me in close contact with the Lua based 2 lmod module system. Rather than fall into the rabbit hole of brew we will leverage the existing system to add our new libraries. Not finding any good collections of these composable environments, and having failed once before to install Nix as a user without admin access, I decided to start my own collection of Lmod recipies.</description></item><item><title>Explorations with Backlight Controllers</title><link>/posts/expl-backlight-control/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/expl-backlight-control/</guid><description>A short post detailing the many trials and tribulations of setting brightness on multiple monitors in tandem.
Background As regular readers might know, I have a multi-screen setup, which accounts for having touch enabled on my primary laptop screen (detailed here). A failing of this setup was that I was not able to control the brightness of both monitors at the same time.
Existing Stack Since I use i3, my brightness control is simply done with bindsym lines as follows1:</description></item><item><title>A Short Guide to Statistical Rethinking²</title><link>/posts/some-sol-sr2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 17:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/some-sol-sr2/</guid><description>A meta post introducing my solutions to the fantastic excellent second edition of &amp;ldquo;Statistical Rethinking&amp;rdquo; by Richard McElreath, a.k.a. Statistical Rethinking². Also discusses strategies to keep up with the material, mostly meant for self-study groups.
Background As detailed previously, I recently was part of a course centered around Bayesian modeling for the Icelandic COVID-19 pandemic. The Bayesian mindset needs no introduction, and this post is completely inadequete to explain why anyone should be interested (that&amp;rsquo;s what the book is for!</description></item><item><title>Multiple Monitors with Touchscreens</title><link>/posts/multi-monitor-touch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 22:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/multi-monitor-touch/</guid><description>A short tutorial post on multiple screens for laptops with touch-support and ArchLinux. Also evolved into a long rant, with an Easter egg.
Background Of late, I have been attempting to move away from paper, for environmental reasons1. Years of touch typing in Colemak (rationale, config changes) and a very customized Emacs setup (including mathematica, temporary latex templates, Nix, and org-roam annotations) have more or less kept me away from analog devices.</description></item><item><title>Analytics II: Goat to Clicky</title><link>/posts/goat-clicky/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2020 23:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/goat-clicky/</guid><description>A follow up to my earlier post on analytics, and on migrating from Goat Counter to Clicky.
Background A few days ago I recieved the following email:
Hi there!
I made some changes to the GoatCounter plans/pricing:
GoatCounter now has a &amp;ldquo;Starter&amp;rdquo; plan, this is €5/month, limited to 100k pageviews/month, comes with a custom domain, and allow commercial use. This is mostly the same as the &amp;ldquo;personal plus&amp;rdquo; plan there was before, except that it allows commercial use.</description></item><item><title>Temporary LaTeX Documents with Orgmode</title><link>/posts/org-arb-tex/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 05:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/org-arb-tex/</guid><description>A post on working with transient TeX templates in orgmode without modifying global configurations. This will also serve as a rudimentary introduction to TeX in orgmode.
Background The sad reality of working in a field dominated by institutional actors which do not care for recognizing software development as a skill is that there are often a lot of ugly LaTeX templates1. In particular, often Universities have arbitrary LaTeX templates from the the dark days of 2010 something, which include gratuitous usage of say, natbib instead of biblatex.</description></item><item><title>Emacs for Nix-R</title><link>/posts/emacs-nix-r/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 00:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/emacs-nix-r/</guid><description>A short post on my current set-up for R with nixpkgs and emacs to auto-compile my system configuration.
Background This is my third post on working with nixpkgs and R.
Part I covered ways of working effectively with R and nixpkgs Part II dealt with composing dependent devtools packages in a per-package environment, with a focus on rethinking and tidybayes.rethinking This final part is about automating the system-wide configuration using emacs.</description></item><item><title>Statistical Rethinking and Nix</title><link>/posts/rethinking-r-nix/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 04:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rethinking-r-nix/</guid><description>This post describes how to set up a transparent automated setup for reproducible R workflows using nixpkgs, niv, and lorri. The explanatory example used throughout the post is one of setting up the rethinking package and running some examples from the excellent second edition of &amp;ldquo;Statistical Rethinking&amp;rdquo; by Richard McElreath.
Background As detailed in an earlier post1, I had set up Nix to work with non-CRAN packages. If the rest of this section is unclear, please refer back to the earlier post.</description></item><item><title>Nix with R and devtools</title><link>/posts/nix-r-devtools/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 05:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/nix-r-devtools/</guid><description>This post discusses briefly, the nix-shell environment for reproducible programming. In particular, there is an emphasis on extensions for installing and working with packages not in CRAN, i.e. packages off Github which are normally installed with devtools.
Background The entire nix ecosystem is fantastic, and is the main packaging system used by d-SEAMS as well. Recently I began working through the excellent second edition of &amp;ldquo;Statistical Rethinking&amp;rdquo; by Richard McElreath1.</description></item><item><title>Compton to Picom and Zoom Glitches</title><link>/posts/compton-zoom-shadow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 01:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/compton-zoom-shadow/</guid><description>Background I have been leading the fantastic section 881 as a virtual section leader for the Stanford CS106A: Code in Place initiative for the past four weeks. I have also spent a lot of time on Zoom, sharing my screen. Fun fact. My screen shares look like this:
Figure 1: Zoom screen share with weird overlay
This post is about hunting down what caused this amazing zoom glitch1 and how I finally fixed it.</description></item><item><title>Refactoring Dotfiles For Colemak</title><link>/posts/colemak-dots-refactor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/colemak-dots-refactor/</guid><description>A more actionable follow up to my personal recollections relating to my switch to Colemak.
Background I have, in the past written about how I made the switch to Colemak. However, until recently, I was still trying to mimic the VIM keybindings from QWERTY. This is a post where I discuss the changes I made to ensure that I never have to stretch my fingers in odd ways again.</description></item><item><title>Pandoc to Orgmode with Babel</title><link>/posts/org-pandoc-babel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 16:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/org-pandoc-babel/</guid><description>Background One of the best things about writing in orgmode is that we can embed and execute arbitrary code snippets. However, not all languages have an exporter, for obvious reasons. Somewhat surprisingly, there is no way to call pandoc on embedded snippets, which feels like a waste, especially when a whole bunch of documentation formats can be converted to orgmode with it.
Consider the following beautifully highlighted snippet of an rst (ReStructured Text) list table.</description></item><item><title>Using Mathematica with Orgmode</title><link>/posts/org-mathematica/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2020 20:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/org-mathematica/</guid><description>Background I have been wanting to find a workflow which allows me to bypass writing a lot of TeX by hand for a while now. To that end I looked into using a computer algebra system (CAS). Naturally, my first choice was the FOSS Maxima (also because it uses Lisp under the hood). However, for all the reasons listed here, relating to its accuracy, which have not been fixed even though the post was over 5 years ago, I ended up having to go with the closed source Mathematica.</description></item><item><title>Analytics: Google to Goat</title><link>/posts/goat-google/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 17:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/goat-google/</guid><description>Background Like a lot of my tech based rants, this was brought on by a recent Hacker News post. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into why the product listed there is a hollow faux FOSS rip-off. I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss how the &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; analytics option, like many others are just hobby projects taking pot shots at other projects. Or how insanely overpriced most alternatives are.
I will however discuss why and how I transitioned to using the awesome Goat Counter.</description></item><item><title>D3 for Git</title><link>/posts/d3git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/d3git/</guid><description>Background I have had a lot of discussions regarding the teaching of git This is mostly as a part of the SoftwareCarpentries, or in view of my involvement with univ.ai, or simply in every public space I am associated with Without getting into my views, I just wanted to keep this resource in mind The site Learning git is a highly contentious thing People seem to be fond of GUI tools, especially since on non *nix systems, it seems that there is a lot of debate surrounding obtaining the git utility in the first place One of the best ways of understanding (without installing stuff) the mental models required for working with git is this site</description></item><item><title>Shorter Posts</title><link>/posts/shortpost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/shortpost/</guid><description>Background Sometime this year, I realized that I no longer have access to a lot of my older communication. This included, a lot of resources I enjoyed and shared with the people who were around me at that point in time. To counter this, I have decided to opt for shorter posts, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t always include the same level of detail I would prefer to provide.
Alternatives I have an automated system based around IFTTT combined with Twitter, Diigo, and even Pocket However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really tell me much, and trawling through a massive glut of data is often pointless as well There&amp;rsquo;s always Twitter, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care to hear the views of others when I want to revisit my own ideas Conclusions I will be making shorter posts here, like the random one on octobox</description></item><item><title>Provisioning Dotfiles on an HPC</title><link>/posts/prov-dots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/prov-dots/</guid><description>Background My dotfiles turned 4 years old a few months ago (since 9th Jan 2017) and remains one of my most frequently updated projects for obvious reasons. Going through the changes reminds me of a whole of posts I never got around to writing.
Anyway, recently I gained access to another HPC cluster, with a standard configuration (bash, old CentOS) and decided to track my provisioning steps. This is really a very streamlined experience by now, since I&amp;rsquo;ve used the same setup across scores of machines.</description></item><item><title>Switching to Colemak</title><link>/posts/colemak-switch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Feb 2020 14:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/colemak-switch/</guid><description>Thoughts on and rationale behind leaving QWERTY and touch typing in general. Followed by this post on refactoring my Dotfiles.
Background I just realized that it has been over two years since I switched from QWERTY to Colemak but somehow never managed to write about it. It was a major change in my life, and it took forever to get acclimatized to. I do not think I&amp;rsquo;ll ever again be in a position to make such a change in my life again, but it was definitely worth it.</description></item><item><title>Pandora and Proxychains</title><link>/posts/pandora-proxychains/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 05:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pandora-proxychains/</guid><description>Background Pandora doesn&amp;rsquo;t work outside the states I keep forgetting how to set-up proxychains Proxychains Technically this article expects proxychains-ng, which seems to be the more up-to-date fork of the original proxychains.
Install proxychains-ng
# I am on archlinux.. sudo pacman -S proxychains-ng Copy the configuration to the $HOME directory
cp /etc/proxychains.conf . Edit said configuration to add some US-based proxy
In my particular case, I don&amp;rsquo;t keep the tor section enabled.</description></item><item><title>Replacing Jupyter with Orgmode</title><link>/posts/jupyter-orgmode/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2020 22:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/jupyter-orgmode/</guid><description>Background I dislike Jupyter notebooks (and JupyterHub) a lot EIN is really not much of a solution either In the past I have written some posts on TeX with JupyterHub and discussed ways to use virtual Python with JupyterHub in a more reasonable manner.
However, I personally found that EIN was a huge pain to work with, and I mostly ended up working with the web-interface anyway.
It is a bit redundant to do so, given that at-least for my purposes, the end result was a LaTeX document.</description></item><item><title>Poetry and Direnv</title><link>/posts/poetry-direnv/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2020 21:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/poetry-direnv/</guid><description>Background I end up writing about using poetry a lot I almost always use direnv in real life too I don&amp;rsquo;t keep writing mini scripts in my .envrc Honestly there&amp;rsquo;s nothing here anyone using the direnv wiki will find surprising, but then it is still neat to link back to.
Setting Up Poetry This essentially works by simply modifying the global .direnvrc which essentially gets sourced by every local .</description></item><item><title>Taming Github Notifications</title><link>/posts/ghnotif/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 11:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ghnotif/</guid><description>Background As a member of several large organizations, I get a lot of github notifications. Not all of these are of relevance to me. This is especially true of psuedo-monorepo style repositories like the JOSS review system and especially the exercism community.
I recently (re-)joined the exercism community as a maintainer for the C++ lessons after having been a (sporadic) teacher This was largely in response to a community call to action as the group needed new blood to usher in v3 of the exercism project Anyway, I have since found that at the small cost of possibly much of my public repo data, I can manage my notifications better with Octobox</description></item></channel></rss>
