Rather than fall into the rabbit hole of brew we will leverage the existing system to add our new libraries. Not finding any good collections of these composable environments, and having failed once before to install Nix as a user without admin access, I decided to start my own collection of Lmod recipies.</description></item><item><title>Provisioning Dotfiles on an HPC</title><link>https://haozeke.github.io/posts/prov-dots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://haozeke.github.io/posts/prov-dots/</guid><description>Background My dotfiles turned 4 years old a few months ago (since 9th Jan 2017) and remains one of my most frequently updated projects for obvious reasons. Going through the changes reminds me of a whole of posts I never got around to writing.
Anyway, recently I gained access to another HPC cluster, with a standard configuration (bash, old CentOS) and decided to track my provisioning steps. This is really a very streamlined experience by now, since I&amp;rsquo;ve used the same setup across scores of machines.</description></item></channel></rss>
